# Nephin Media
This is a personal portfolio website I developed in my 3rd year of Computing and Digital Media at ATU Galway, as part of the Professional Practice in IT module. It is styled as an (ultimately fictitious) company owned by me named 'Nephin Media', named after the [tallest standalone mountain in Ireland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nephin), which is out in Connemara near my hometown.

It is written in HTML, JavaScript and CSS, with interactive elements such as login and registration scripted in PHP, and designed to be ran on Apache via [WAMP](https://www.wampserver.com/) (or some equivalent framework such as [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)) on a virtual machine. This also connects it to a MySQL database designed for storage of user credentials, as well as user queries/requests.

When I have time, I intend to rewrite this site so that it may be hosted on GitHub Pages, and serve as a sort of digital portfolio for my work.
